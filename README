A python script to generate a poster of Unicode characters. Outputs PDF.

By default, it generates a 3-foot high poster (typical size for large-format
printers) of all printable Unicode characters. You can also generate posters of
different heights and with characters from particular scripts using command line
arguments. Note that you can specify multiple scripts using multiple '--script'
args.

Requires the lxml, cairo, pango, and pangocairo python modules. Also requires a
copy of the Unicode Character Database (in the form of a flat XML file), and a
copy of the Default Unicode Collation Element Table ("allkeys.txt"). These can
be found at

http://www.unicode.org/Public/6.1.0/ucdxml/ucd.all.flat.zip

and

http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/6.1.0/allkeys.txt

for the 6.1.0 version of Unicode. You'll need to unzip the ucd file. Using these
files directly means you can generate posters for new versions of Unicode as
soon as they're available! (Although, finding fonts may be tough.)

Note that if you want a character to actually have a glyph of some sort on the
poster, pango will need to find a font with a glyph for it. See the pango docs
for details, but the simplest way to add fonts it can find is to just put them
in your $HOME/.fonts directory.
